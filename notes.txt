First project with all three layouts for mobile, tablet, desktop

New concepts learned:

First time applying Picture functionality in HTML setting source sets for different pictures to load
based on media query inside html.  Also added .webp and @2x versions.

Investigated how these were loaded using the Network feature in Google Inspector

Applied linear gradients via variables in css 

Really had to learn more in depth about position relative/absolute due to the hero picture needing to cut
out into the top of the page and over the header.  This also reinforced the concept of pulling the content
out of line when using absolute because they image container no longer was barrier for margins on other elements.

Had to apply z-axis to top button in order to have hover functionality becaue in tablet and desktop the hero image container was actually 
over the button even though it was white space and the button was visible.

Overall pretty happy with result, near pixel perfect on all three layouts.
